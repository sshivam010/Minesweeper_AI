# Minesweeper_AI
Minesweeper is a puzzle game that consists of a grid of cells, where some of the cells contain hidden “mines.” Clicking on a cell that contains a mine detonates the mine, and causes the user to lose the game. Clicking on a “safe” cell (i.e., a cell that does not contain a mine) reveals a number that indicates how many neighboring cells – where a neighbor is a cell that is one square to the left, right, up, down, or diagonal from the given cell – contain a mine.  

There are two main files : runner.py and minesweeper.py. minesweeper.py contains all of the logic the game itself and for the AI to play the game. runner.py has b contains all of the code to run the graphical interface for the game.
